# 🏁 Agile Final Project – E-commerce Product Catalog

## 📌 Capstone Project | Agile Methodology

This project simulates the development of a product catalog backend for an e-commerce website using Agile practices such as Scrum and Kanban. The goal is to apply sprint planning, user story creation, backlog management, and sprint execution in a realistic development scenario.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a backend system that supports essential product catalog features, including:

- Create, retrieve, update, and delete products
- Like and dislike functionality
- List and filter products
- Cloud hosting with automated deployment

---

## 👥 Simulated Roles

Throughout the project, I assumed the following Agile roles:

- **Product Owner**: Created and prioritized user stories
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitated sprint planning and backlog refinement
- **Developer**: Executed tasks and managed workflow on the Kanban board

---

## 📋 Stakeholder Requirements

The following stakeholder needs were translated into user stories:

1. Ability to create a product in the catalog  
2. Ability to retrieve a product from the catalog  
3. Ability to update a product in the catalog  
4. Ability to delete a product from the catalog  
5. Ability to like a product  
6. Ability to dislike a product  
7. Ability to list all products  
8. Ability to query a subset of products  
9. Must be hosted in the cloud  
10. Must have automated deployment to the cloud

## 🧰 Tool Used

To manage the Agile workflow, I used **GitHub Projects**, which provides a Kanban-style interface for organizing and tracking user stories.

### Key Features Utilized:

- Kanban board with columns: Icebox, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review/QA, Done  
- Custom issue templates for user stories  
- Labels for task categorization (`enhancement`, `technical debt`)  
- Milestones for sprint tracking  
- Burndown chart to visualize sprint progress

This tool enabled a realistic simulation of Agile team collaboration and iterative delivery.
